               <li><a id="mark"></a><h3>Mark Hoppus</h3>

                    <p>Mark Hoppus was born March 15<sup>th</sup>, 1972 in Ridgecrest, California. His parents divorced in third grade, and he was constantly moving between their houses. He began expressing interest in the punk/skate scene in middle school, and at age 15 his father got him his first bass guitar. After moving to San Diego in 1992, Mark's sister introduced him to Tom Delonge. The two later paired up with Scott Raynor to create Blink 182. Mark Hoppus founded the band in 1992, and was a member until 2005 when the group split up. He dropped out of college in the early 1990's when the band started to take off. He later reformed the band with Tom and Travis to record their hit comeback <em>Neighborhoods</em>.</p></li>

                    <a id="travis"></a><h3>Travis Barker</h3>
                    <p>Travis Barker was born November 14<sup>th</sup>, 1975 in Fontana, California. He began playing drums at age 5, learning from <em>Thomas Hogan</em>. In junior high Travis learned the piano, and briefly tried singing, but somehow always found his way back to drums. His mother died from cancer the day Travis started high school, her parting words being to</p> <blockquote>"...Keep playing music and to follow [your] dreams."</blockquote><p> His senior year of high school, Travis skipped out on the marching band to travel in his rock band. In 1998 he replaced <em>Scott Raynor</em> as Blink 182's drummer.</p></li>

                    <a id="tom"></a><h3>Tom Delonge</h3>
                    <p>Tom Delonge was born December 13<sup>th</sup>, 1975 in Poway, California. After being expelled from Poway High School for drinking at a basketball game, he met <em>Anne Hoppus</em> at Rancho Bernardo High School, who then introduced him to Mark Hoppus. Tom managed to play a guitar at a friend's house, and soon started working three jobs to buy his first fender. Tom's parents divorced when he was 18, which provided him inspiration for the song <em>Stay Together For the Kids</em>. After being introduced to <em>Mark Hoppus</em> Tom recruited <em>Scott Raynor</em> who he has met at the school's Battle of the Bands. The original name for the band was Duck Tape. </p></li>

                <li><a id="scott"></a><h3>(Ex-Drummer) Scott Raynor</h3>
                    <p>Scott was born on May 23<sup>rd</sup>, 1978. He was the drummer for Duck Tape/Blink 182 until being fired for his excessive alcohol abuse. He claims that he and Tom had formed the band, and Mark was brought in later.</p>
                <blockquote>"I put 6 years into something I loved and not only is it stolen from me by people I thought were my friends, but I am left behind in the dust. I started that band with Tom. They even made some story about how DeLonge and Hoppus met and then recruited me, they are rewriting the books, it's weird."
                    â€”Scott Raynor</blockquote></li>
