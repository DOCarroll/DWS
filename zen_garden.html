    <h3>The Kyoto Forest</h3>
        <p>The first css layout I chose was the Kyoto Forest, found at http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/207/207.css.</p>
        <p>This css layout did a few things. My favorite being the image positioned at the top center, it creates a smooth transition to the background white color. Also, the headers were placed inside of background images./p>
    <h3>Make 'em Proud</h3>
        <p>This developer used almost exactly the same methods as the previous one. The only difference is in his code, he defined the background images inside the preamble classes.</p>
    <h3>Ocean Scape</h3>
        <p>This developer simply defines styles based on size, color, and font, but adds diversity by placing divider images between headers.</p>
